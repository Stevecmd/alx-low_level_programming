# 0x1A. C - Hash tables 

## Requirements
### General

 - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
 - All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
 - All your files should end with a new line
 - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
 - Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
 - You are not allowed to use global variables
 - No more than 5 functions per file
 - You are allowed to use the C standard library
 - The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `hash_tables.h`
 - Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
 - All your header files should be include guarded

## More Info
### Data Structures

Please use these data structures for this project:\
```c

/**
 * struct hash_node_s - Node of a hash table
 *
 * @key: The key, string
 * The key is unique in the HashTable
 * @value: The value corresponding to a key
 * @next: A pointer to the next node of the List
 */
typedef struct hash_node_s
{
     char *key;
     char *value;
     struct hash_node_s *next;
} hash_node_t;

/**
 * struct hash_table_s - Hash table data structure
 *
 * @size: The size of the array
 * @array: An array of size @size
 * Each cell of this array is a pointer to the first node of a linked list,
 * because we want our HashTable to use a Chaining collision handling
 */
typedef struct hash_table_s
{
     unsigned long int size;
     hash_node_t **array;
} hash_table_t;

```

## Tasks
0. >>> ht = {} 
Write a function that creates a hash table.

 - Prototype: `hash_table_t *hash_table_create(unsigned long int size);`
     - where `size` is the size of the array
 - Returns a pointer to the newly created hash table
 - If something went wrong, your function should return `NULL`
